    <h1>Experiencing Nature in Ithaca</h1>
    <p>Ithaca's natural beauty has given me the opportunity to explore stunning landscapes, witness unique weather phenomena, and gain a deeper appreciation for geology and astronomy. The combination of gorges, waterfalls, and Cayuga Lake makes for an amazing backdrop to my time here.</p>

    <h2>Natural Phenomena I've Learned About</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>How Northern Lights Happen</strong> - The aurora borealis occurs when charged solar particles collide with gases in Earth’s atmosphere, producing vibrant light displays.</li>
        <li><strong>What a Snow Squall Is</strong> - A sudden, intense burst of snowfall and strong winds that can reduce visibility in seconds, common in upstate NY.</li>
        <li><strong>Why Ithaca’s Gorges Are Special</strong> - The region’s deep gorges were carved by glacial activity thousands of years ago, creating the waterfalls and rock formations we see today.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Exploring Ithaca has deepened my appreciation for both nature and science, making each outdoor adventure more meaningful.</p>
