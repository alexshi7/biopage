## Food Tab:

The Food Culture of Ithaca

Ithaca has a vibrant and diverse food scene that caters to a mix of students, faculty, and locals. Collegetown, in particular, is packed with restaurants designed to satisfy the palates of busy Cornell students, offering everything from affordable takeout to upscale dining. The Ithaca Commons also features a variety of international cuisines, local cafes, and family-owned eateries that make exploring food here a real treat.

Whether it's the surprise of a well-prepared meal in the dining halls or the hidden gems scattered throughout Ithaca, my stomach has been satisfied.

Favorite Restaurants:

FICCC - My church has some great food!

Morrison Dining Hall - My Dorm and local dining hall; the variety is great.

Cafes on campus - Perfect for a quick bite between classes.

Taste of Thai - My girlfriend and I love this for date nights.

Asian Chili Spot - My go-to for flavorful takeout in Collegetown.

Mia's Restaurant - A great menu with tapas and cozy sit-down vibes.

## Courses Tab:

One of the best parts about studying at Cornell is its open curriculum. Unlike some universities that have strict general education requirements, Cornell offers flexibility in course selection, allowing students to explore their interests across disciplines. This has enabled me to take a mix of computer science, economics, psychology, and even astronomy courses.

Courses I've Taken:

CS 1110: Introduction to Python programming and computational problem-solving.

ECON 1120: Macroeconomics, covering topics like GDP, inflation, and economic growth.

ANTHR 1101: Introductory anthropology, exploring human cultures and societies.

Freshman Spring:

CS 2110: Object-oriented programming and data structures in Java.

MATH 2940: Linear algebra with applications in engineering and science.

ECON 1110: Microeconomics, focusing on market structures and consumer behavior.

CS 1340: A creative approach to computational art and generative design.

Sophomore Fall:

CS 2800: Discrete structures in computer science, covering logic, proofs, and graphs.

CS 3110: Functional programming in OCaml and software development principles.

PSYCH 1101: An introduction to psychology, from cognitive processes to behavior.

CHIN 2209: Advanced Chinese language and cultural immersion.

Sophomore Spring:

AEM 2210: Financial accounting and business principles.

## Nature Tab:

Experiencing Nature in Ithaca

Ithaca's natural beauty has given me the opportunity to explore stunning landscapes, witness unique weather phenomena, and gain a deeper appreciation for geology and astronomy. The combination of gorges, waterfalls, and Cayuga Lake makes for an amazing backdrop to my time here.

Adventures & Discoveries:

Fishing in Beebe Lake - A peaceful retreat from busy campus life.

Meteor showers over Cayuga Lake - A breathtaking display of celestial wonders, especially on clear winter nights.

Aurora Borealis - A rare but unforgettable experience seeing the northern lights, caused by solar particles interacting with Earth’s magnetic field.

Buttermilk Falls State Park - A gorgeous cascade of waterfalls perfect for hikes.

Gorge Swimming at Second Dam - One of the best ways to cool off during the warmer months.

Natural Phenomena I've Learned About:

How Northern Lights Happen - The aurora borealis occurs when charged solar particles collide with gases in Earth’s atmosphere, producing vibrant light displays.

What a Snow Squall Is - A sudden, intense burst of snowfall and strong winds that can reduce visibility in seconds, common in upstate NY.

Why Ithaca’s Gorges Are Special - The region’s deep gorges were carved by glacial activity thousands of years ago, creating the waterfalls and rock formations we see today.

Exploring Ithaca has deepened my appreciation for both nature and science, making each outdoor adventure more meaningful.
