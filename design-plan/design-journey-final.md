# Project 1, Final Milestone: Design Journey

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Milestone 3 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 3 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

I didn't lose any points, so I didn't revise anything due to the rubric; I had excellent Feedback. However, I added more content to my courses.html, I felt it was a little bare and didn't want to risk it.


## Example Website Emotion Analysis

2. Reflect on the emotions your experience when using the website.
3. Analyze how the website's use of color, decorative imagery, typography, shape, and alignment contribute to these emotions.
