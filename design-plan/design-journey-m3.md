# Project 1, Milestone 3: Design Journey

In milestone 3 you will analyze your example websites use of CSS properties and create a styled **draft** of your personal website's homepage.

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullet points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the **`design-plan`** folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.

> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 2 feedback (1-2 sentences)

## Example Website CSS Property Analysis

For each example website you identified in milestone 1:

1. Include the same screenshot of the example website you included in Milestone 1.
2. Identify 2 parts of the design that you want to analyze for CSS properties.
3. For each part of the design, list the CSS properties for shape, color, and typography that you might use to create a similar design on your personal website.
