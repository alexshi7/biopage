# Project 1, Milestone 2: Design Journey

For milestone 2, you will design the information architecture for all the pages of your website.  Your milestone 2 design journey will document this process.

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Milestone 1 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 1 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

TODO: milestone 1 feedback revisions


## Information Architecture

Design the information architecture for all the pages your website.

You may change your homepage content based on your card sorting. If you do change the homepage content, you don't need to go back to the previous milestone design journey and update it. Instead, just include the new plan in the section below (Content Organization).

### Content Organization
> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here.
> You should have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration. (1-2 sentences)
> Please physically sort cards; please don't do this digitally.

TODO: photos and explanations of each iteration


### Final Content Organization
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website? (1 sentence)

TODO: tell us which iteration of card sorting you plan to use.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences. (1-2 sentences)

TODO: why does this organization make sense for your audience (not you)?


### Navigation
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- TODO: page 1
- TODO: page 2
- TODO: page 3
- ...

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience. (1-2 sentences)

TODO: explain why the pages name make sense to the audience.
