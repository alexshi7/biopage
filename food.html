        <h1>The Food Culture of Ithaca</h1>
        <p>Ithaca has a vibrant and diverse food scene that caters to a mix of students, faculty, and locals. Collegetown, in particular, is packed with restaurants designed to satisfy the palates of busy Cornell students, offering everything from affordable takeout to upscale dining. The Ithaca Commons also features a variety of international cuisines, local cafes, and family-owned eateries that make exploring food here a real treat.</p>
        <p>Whether it's the surprise of a well-prepared meal in the dining halls or the hidden gems scattered throughout Ithaca, my stomach has been satisfied.</p>
